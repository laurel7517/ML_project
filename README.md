# ML_project
This is a group project for Machine Learning class.

Group Member: Ziqi Chen(zc1690), Liumei Ma(lm4180).

The topic is to identify several kinds of instruments by using the machine learning method. 
We are still trying on different models to reach the best performance. 
Currently, we can achieve correctness by about 80%.
